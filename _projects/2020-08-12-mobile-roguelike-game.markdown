#### Mobile Rogue-Like Game (History)

This project revolves around my indepently made mobile game, a currently un-named 'Rogue-Like' game developed in Unity. This project began following a long-running interest in these types of games over the past year. Many different versions of the same rough idea have sprouted out across mobile platforms, and seem to all bring a large following with them. The most popular example of this, is the game 'Archero' standing for 'Archer Hero'. The premise of this game and those like it is as the player you move between several rooms filled with various enemies that attack you. As you move around, you try to dodge the incoming attacks. Standing still however, causes the player to start automatically targeting and attacking the closest enemy to themselves. Once a room is clear, the player is rewarded with in-game exp and they move to the next room. The real minute-to-minute excitement of this comes from the large varierty of abilities obtained throughout your playthrough. Each time the player ranks up, they are given a choice between three random abilities that will effect the rest of their gameplay. These abilities vary from increasing the amount of projectiles the player shoots, to adding various elemental effects when hitting enemies. As well as the in-game abilities, the player can collect a massive variety of equipment that will boost their stats throughout the game, encouraging the player to participate more and more to reach the further levels. It's a very fast paced, hyper-active game that keeps players coming back for more with a free-to-play monetisation system. As a long time player of this game, and those like it, I decided it'd be a really interesting project to develop for my own first public game, and as such, this project was started.


#### Differences With This Game

When developing this game, in order to add more variety against other similar games, I researched some of the more specific criticisms fans have of these games. This is particularly easy to understand when following the Reddit for a particular game. Here you will find some of the most enthusiatic fans, and as such, you will see them present their most honest feedback about what makes the game good, and what could make it better. For example, one of the most common critiques I've seen mentioned revolves around the gaining of particular equipment. There are various weapon types that people are accustomed to, and in order to better upgrade these items, a 'fusing' system is in place requiring three of the same item in order to achieve the next rarity level and further improve the stats. With the ever-increasing item pool, and the randomness of obtaining a particular item, it requires a massive amount of game time or 'grinding' in order to have a chance of improving a particular item you're used to. That's why with the game I'm developing, one of the core ideas will be to make specific character types which each have certain equipment sets. When playing through levels, they will only have a chance of dropping items specifically for that character type. This means that players can essentially level various characters separately from one another if they have a particular play-style. I belive this will make a significant improvement with player feedback. I am also planning a much more in-depth customisation system that will allow the player to really customise each of their pieces of equipment through varying attachments, effecting specific stats over others. So if for example, a player wanted their weapon to focus entirely on firing as fast as possible, then they could adjust their item in such a way that increases the attack speed, while reducing it's damage and critical hit chance. This system is not entirely planned out yet, but will hopefully be quite complex in the varierty each player can experience.


### Development Stage

Currently, this game is firmly in the early stages of development. A lot of the core gameplay mechanics through the level are there, but variety in characters, or weapons or enemies is still limited as these are quite big areas to expand on. I am currently in the process of planning out how the main menu scene of the game will operate, which will be where the player controls everything outside of the chapter gameplay relating to character customisation etc. As I continue to work on this project, I will update this page further.
