#### Endless Runner Game

This is the second game I have been tasked with making as part of my Low Level Programming module in the second year of University and it was made in the ASGE (Awesome Sauce Game Engine) C++ framework. It was developed in the time space of about four weeks and features endless gameplay with high score options kept on the main menu. The gameplay features the ability to jump and long jump as well as being able to run faster to get score quicker and also to stop time, which allows you to dodge any oncoming missiles headed towards the player.
