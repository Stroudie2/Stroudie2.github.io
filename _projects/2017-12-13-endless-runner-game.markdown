#### Endless Runner Game

This is the second game I have been tasked with making as part of my Low Level Programming module in the second year of University and it was made in the ASGE (Awesome Sauce Game Engine) C++ framework. It was developed in the time space of about four weeks and features endless gameplay with high score options kept on the main menu. As of now, this is the most recent game I have made in C++ as part of my module on the language.


#### Gameplay Features

This game features constant automatic movement where the player's score will increase at a rate based on their chosen difficulty. After a short period of there being no obstacles, they will start to randomly generate for the player, forcing them to dodge the different types. They will have to use a mix of jumps, long jumps, crouches and abilities in order to dodge the obstacles found on ground level as well as the shooting projectiles heading straight towards the player.


#### Abilities

The player has access to two different abilities that can be especially useful for dodging the flying projectiles. If the player holds down the "D" or "RIGHT" key while playing, they will start speeding up faster than the environment, causing them to run forward. While running, the constant score will increase at a higher rate than standard movement. It also allows the player to run quickly down a hill in order to dodge an oncoming missile.
The other ability you have as the player is the option to stop time as the environment continues to move. If you know you are not going to be able to easily dodge an oncoming missile that is close to hitting you, you can hold down either "A" or "LEFT" in order to freeze the character in place as the missile shoots past. This is very useful, but be careful to not let the character fall so far back that you hit the back wall. This will cause the player to die.
