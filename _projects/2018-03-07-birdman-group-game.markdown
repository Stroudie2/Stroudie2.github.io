#### Birdman Group Game

This is the third 2D game that I have made inside of the ASGE C++ framework. For this assignment, we were put into groups and were asked to develop a game based on the loose concept of the movie "Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)". Given that this film is difficult to find a solid theme for, we were given the freedom to make the game styled however we want as long as there was some link back to the film. Our group decided to focus on the scene of the movie where Riggan is found locked out of the theatre without his clothes and has to make his way back. We ran with this idea and decided to make a stealth based game where you have to find your clothes and get back to the theatre without being seen.


#### Gameplay Features

This game features constant automatic movement where the player's score will increase at a rate based on their chosen difficulty. After a short period of there being no obstacles, they will start to randomly generate for the player, forcing them to dodge the different types. They will have to use a mix of jumps, long jumps, crouches and abilities in order to dodge the obstacles found on ground level as well as the shooting projectiles heading straight towards the player.


#### Abilities

The player has access to two different abilities that can be especially useful for dodging the flying projectiles. If the player holds down the "D" or "RIGHT" key while playing, they will start speeding up faster than the environment, causing them to run forward. While running, the constant score will increase at a higher rate than standard movement. It also allows the player to run quickly down a hill in order to dodge an oncoming missile.
The other ability you have as the player is the option to stop time as the environment continues to move. If you know you are not going to be able to easily dodge an oncoming missile that is close to hitting you, you can hold down either "A" or "LEFT" in order to freeze the character in place as the missile shoots past. This is very useful, but be careful to not let the character fall so far back that you hit the back wall. This will cause the player to die.
