#### Shadow of Atari

This project was part of my third year Uni module "Commercial Games Development". During the first term, we have been placed in groups and tasked with making 3 different small game jams over a time period of just two weeks. The first of these was to re-create a modern game title as though it was running on an Atari 2600.


#### Gameplay Features

This game is a more simplistic version of Shadow of the Colossus, whereby the player is tasked with bringing down a giant titan from scaling up and hitting its weak spots. In it's current stage, the game has just the one level where players can compete for a high score on the leaderboard which is measured by the time taken to defeat the boss. There is a draining stamina bar that will force you to time your climb as well as a basic arm attack from the boss when you are near to it.
