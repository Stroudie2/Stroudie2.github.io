#### Terraform

This project was the third game jam of my third year University module "Commercial Games Development". During the first term, we have been placed in groups and tasked with making 3 different small game jams over a time period of just two weeks. This final game was called "Terraform" and came from a random game jam generator which gave out the theme of "A horror game where you taunt tunnels with terraforming." With this theme, the group came up with the idea of a explorer game whereby the player must escape the cave before their inevitable death. It was also decided to use procedural level generation for creating the map, to add another more technical and random layer to the game.


#### Gameplay Features

The gameplay features a first person experience whereby the player will find themselves in the centre of a cave, surrounded by multiple connected rooms. Some of the exits on these rooms will require knocking down some rocks in order to proceed to the next room. The player will blow up these walls by throwing gas containers, found at the spawn point of the game. Through navigating the randomly generated map, the player must find the end point to escape before they drown from the rising water.
