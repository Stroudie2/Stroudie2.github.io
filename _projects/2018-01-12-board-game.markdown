#### "Independence" Board Game

This is one of the assignments for my second year module "Play & Games. It focuses around a group project of designing and creating a modern tabletop game based around a current social, political or economic subject that should be researched. As part of a five person group, I was involved in doing some thorough research into current events and how some of them could be tied into an interesting game concept. The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate that even without the modern tools of game engines and computer code, the principles of game design have been around for centuries through the use of board games that require lots of thinking into designing. The key difference between designing software/games and designing a board game is that you are creating exactly the experience that the player will have. Unlike video games, where the player is typically given the freedom to do as they wish and you don't know what it will play like until you have created something, with a board game, everything you create will be something the player can experience. For this reason, it is important to make sure the game is playable without any big hitches that could cause a player an easy win over and over.
