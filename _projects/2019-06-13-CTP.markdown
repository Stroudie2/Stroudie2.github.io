#### Emotional Response

This is my end of degree independent creative project whereby I explored the effectiveness of different gameplay techniques on a player's emotional responses.


#### Gameplay Features

As part of the work done on the planes, the other core feature added was the ability to drop bombs from the sky. This would give players in planes the oppurtunity to fly over grounded players and try to eliminate them from the sky. Lots of consideration was made for balancing the gameplay of the planes as well as allowing multiple planes to dog-fight each other in the air. The team also took part in developing our own map to use with the planes, made using the new level editor. You can find attached below a link to a demonstration trailer of our groups work on the game.
