#### Crusade Turn Based Group Game

This is the final programming game to be made as part of the Low Level Programming Module in my second year of University. As with the other projects made this year, it involved using the ASGE C++ framework as part of a group of four in order to create a two player turn based combat game. For this brief, we were told that we had to choose one of two common mechanics found within games. One mechanic relies more heavily on the combat of the game and the other relies more on exploration outside of the battles between players.


#### Gameplay Features
The gameplay for Crusade takes place in turns whereby one team will play all of their characters before it switches to the other player. Before a game begins, both clients will be able to select their team setup and choose how many of the five character types they have on their team. All of the types do different when played against other types and some are melee, while some are ranged. The gameplay plays like a mix of a classic turn based combat game with an emphasis on having to move your characters in range of the enemy, much like chess. This makes for an interesting design when watching players come up with different ways to handle attacking each other.



#### Development
For this project, there was a group of four of us developing it. For the most part, I spent my time on creating the gameplay aspects in terms of the board, the movement and the attacking. This was definitely the biggest project I have worked on this year but was also the most fun experience at the end in terms of how the gameplay felt to play.
