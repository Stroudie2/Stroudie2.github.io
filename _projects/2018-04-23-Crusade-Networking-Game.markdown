#### Crusade Turn Based Group Game

This is the final programming game to be made as part of the Low Level Programming Module in my second year of University. As with the other projects made this year, it involved using the ASGE C++ framework as part of a group of four in order to create a two player turn based combat game. For this brief, we were told that we had to choose one of two common mechanics found within games. One mechanic relies more heavily on the combat of the game and the other relies more on exploration outside of the battles between players.
