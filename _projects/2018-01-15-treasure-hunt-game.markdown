#### Treasure Hunt programming assignment
This was the first program/game that I had to code for my "Entertainment Software Development" module of the first year of University. As it was the first programming assignment given, it was a much more simple game than some of the others I have developed. The game worked similarly to Minesweeper in the way that there is a grid for you to dig in. The difference with this is that there was only one cell that contained the treasure and the player has to guess which row and column this can be found in.

As this game is very simple in terms of its gameplay, there is the additional option for the user to choose the grid size which they want to play on where they can choose the number of rows and columns. The main reason for the simplicity of this project is because this was set after only being taught C++ for a short time, so it allowed me to show off the basic knowledge which I had learned so far at that stage.
