#### Kachiku64

This project was the second game jam of my third year Uni module "Commercial Games Development". During the first term, we have been placed in groups and tasked with making 3 different small game jams over a time period of just two weeks. This second game was called "Super Trash Heroes", in which we were tasked with creating a new game type using assets from an old game jam project. There was an emphasis on the theme of recycling with this jam and as such the game we created is a competitive mode whereby four players attempt to recycle the most objects in order to get the highest score.


#### Gameplay Features

The gameplay features four different playable characters and is set in htree different zones of the map. In each zone, the 'enemy' dumpster truck will shoot out lots of destructible trash bags. When hit by a character, these trash bags will launch a varierty of objects, including some types of fruit as well as types of trash. Each player will then attempt to pick up an object before throwing it into their own recycling truck. Each type of item has a different point value, where trash items will increase the score and fruit items will decrease. At the end of each zone when the players get to their trucks, they will be ordered in the positions of the player's scores. 

Players also have the option to hit other players trucks. Doing so several times will cause the last item to shoot back out of said truck along with the points from this being taken away from the player. On top of this, players can also hit each other in order to temporarily kill them. This will give them a short amount of time to get ahead of the player just knocked out.
