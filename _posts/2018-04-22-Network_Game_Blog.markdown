<b>Crusade progress</b>

This is the final game of the yera to be made in the ASGE C++ framework and is the second to be done as part of a group. The difference with this one is that it requires the use of a networking library to allow two different clients to play together in a turn based combat game using a server to send data between the clients.
We started off by planning what sort of game we wanted to make and decided to go with an old fashioned turn-based game whereby for each player, they can use one move for all of their five characters before ending their turn.
