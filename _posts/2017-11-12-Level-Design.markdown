I have recently begun work on my Level Design assignment, which requires me to design a full playable platformer level. There are different requirements for this, including having different upgrade abilities spread throughout the course of the level. As such, I have designed some images for what these pickups might look like in the level. This is for part of the level design document I am currently working on.
