I have recently begun work on my Level Design assignment, which requires me to design a full playable platformer level. There are different requirements for this, including having different upgrade abilities spread throughout the course of the level. As such, I have designed some images for what these pickups might look like in the level. This is for part of the level design document I am currently working on.
#### Double Jump
The first image here is the powerup of double jump. You will find on the page details of how the pickup will look as weel as the design for the pickup icon.

#### Crowbar
The next powerup is a melee weapon that will allow the player to break weaker obstalces in the level. This will help them to reach the end.

#### Gun
The following two images feature details on how the gun will work which will allow the player to both push objects away, and pull them towards themselves.

#### Context
The final picture here is some details on the context of the level.
