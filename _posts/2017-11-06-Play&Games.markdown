#### Board Game Log
Over the last few weeks me and my grou have been meeting up and designing our Board game concept "Black Liquid". This has been a really interesting project and I have really enjoyed the idea of working as a collective team to create a new game concept. Creating a board game is quite different to designing a piece of software, as you have to think about the fact that every component that you design for the game, is going to be something actually experiences by the players themselves. This is different to software, where there is a lot of logic work going on in the background that is not seen by the user to create the result of what they are experiencing.
