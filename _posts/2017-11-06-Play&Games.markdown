#### Board Game Log
Over the last few weeks me and my grou have been meeting up and designing our Board game concept "Black Liquid". This has been a really interesting project and I have really enjoyed the idea of working as a collective team to create a new game concept. Creating a board game is quite different to designing a piece of software, as you have to think about the fact that every component that you design for the game, is going to be something actually experiences by the players themselves. This is different to software, where there is a lot of logic work going on in the background that is not seen by the user to create the result of what they are experiencing.

We started the deasign process by coming up with a concept and setting of what it would be based around. We knew that we had to base it around a current cultural, political or economic issue. With this in mind, we began researching news websites, looking at what's been in the news recently. We came across an article talking about setting a minimum price upon alcohol products in Wales. This was quite an interesting story and so it made us start to think about the theme of alcohol, and how we could base a game around that. After a few different ideas, Liam came up with the idea of the Government placing an entire ban on alcohol and making it illegal to sell or purchase. This was an interesting idea that quickly sparked more ideas from it. We quickly thought about the potential of the players being part of a gang for the "black market of alcohol". We stuck with this idea of a theme and quickly started thinking about how the game would be played.

With the idea of you being part of a gang, we first thought that you would be playing against the government, trying to work to make as much money as you can from illegally selling alcohol. We soon thought that the game would be more interesting if there was more competitiveness to it against the other players as oppose to you all working together. So we decided that each player would be part of a different black market gang and they would all be fighting for the most control over the black market for their gang.
